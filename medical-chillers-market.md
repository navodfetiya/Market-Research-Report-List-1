<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Cooled Medical Chillers</li><li>Water-Cooled Medical Chillers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical chillers market is primarily divided into two types: air-cooled and water-cooled chillers. Air-cooled medical chillers utilize ambient air to dissipate heat, making them suitable for smaller setups and locations with limited water supply. They are easier to install and require less maintenance. In contrast, water-cooled medical chillers use water for cooling and are typically more efficient, making them ideal for larger facilities with higher cooling demands. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining optimal temperatures for medical equipment and processes.</p></p>
