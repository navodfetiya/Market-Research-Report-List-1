<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Luminous Paints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radioactive Substance</li><li>Light-Charged Substance</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Luminous paints are categorized mainly into two types: those containing radioactive substances and those with light-charged substances. Radioactive luminous paints use materials like radium to emit a glow, primarily utilized in watch dials and instrument panels. Conversely, light-charged luminous paints harness photoluminescent materials, such as zinc sulfide or strontium aluminate, which absorb ambient light and re-emit it in the dark. These latter paints are increasingly popular for safety applications and decorative purposes, given their non-toxic and safer characteristics.</p></p>
