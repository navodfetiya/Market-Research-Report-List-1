<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Evaporative Cooling Towers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Cooling</li><li>Indirect Cooling</li><li>Two Stage Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Evaporative cooling towers are categorized into three main types: direct cooling, indirect cooling, and two-stage cooling. </p><p>In direct cooling, warm air cools water through direct contact, offering high efficiency and compact design. Indirect cooling uses a heat exchanger, separating air and water, which minimizes contamination risk but may require more space. Two-stage cooling combines both methods, enhancing efficiency, especially in extreme conditions. Each type serves different applications, driven by factors like efficiency, space, and water quality requirements.</p></p>
