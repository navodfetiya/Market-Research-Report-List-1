<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion Flexible Flat Panel Detectors</li><li>Indirect Conversion Flexible Flat Panel Detectors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flexible flat panel detector market is categorized into two main types: direct conversion and indirect conversion detectors. Direct conversion flexible flat panel detectors utilize materials that directly convert X-rays into electrical signals, offering high sensitivity and image quality. In contrast, indirect conversion detectors first convert X-rays into visible light using scintillator materials, which is then transformed into electrical signals, typically resulting in a lower cost but potentially reduced image quality. Both types are essential for advanced medical imaging applications.</p></p>
